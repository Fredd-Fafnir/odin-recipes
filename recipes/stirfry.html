        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth.<br>
                    Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
                    Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
                    Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade.<br>
                    Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.<br>
                    Serve over rice.
                </p>
